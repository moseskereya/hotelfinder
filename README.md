Hotel finder app
Do you want to follow with this?
Please consider following the steps below.

1.Set up a new React project: If you haven't already, create a new React project using Create React App or your preferred method.
2. Install dependencies: Install the required dependencies for your project. Make sure to include google-map-react and any other packages you need for your app.
3. Set up Google Maps API: Obtain a Google Maps API key by creating a project in the Google Cloud Console. Make sure to enable the "Maps JavaScript API" for your project.
4.Create the Map component: Create a new component called Map that will render the Google Map using the GoogleMapReact library. Inside the component, set up the map options, including the API key, default center, and zoom level.
5. Fetch hotel data: Retrieve the hotel data from your backend or an API. This can be done using fetch or any other data fetching method. Store the hotel data in the component's state or pass it as props.
6. Render markers: Map over the hotel data and create markers on the map using the FaLocationArrow icon or custom markers. Set the marker coordinates and any additional information you want to display.
7.Handle marker click: Implement a function to handle the click event on the markers. This function can open a modal or show more details about the clicked hotel.
8. Create a modal component: Build a modal component that will display the hotel details when a marker is clicked. You can use the React Modal library or create your own modal component using CSS and React state.
9. Style the components: Add CSS styles to customize the appearance of your components, including the map, markers, modal, and any other elements.
10. Run the app: Start your React development server and run the app in the browser. Make sure there are no console errors and that the map and markers are displayed correctly.
11.Test and debug: Test your app's functionality, including marker clicks, modal display, and any other features. Use the browser's developer tools to debug and fix any issues that arise.
12.Deploy the app: When you're ready, deploy your app to a hosting platform or server of your choice. This will make your app accessible to users.
Remember to provide clear instructions in your code comments or documentation on how to obtain and set up the Google Maps API key, as well as any other necessary configurations.
